        <p>I am a <b>Data Scientist</b> with 5 years of experience in analyzing data and building models to
            help
            companies make better decisions, Currently persuing <b>masters in Computer Science with
                Artificial Intelligence</b>
            at <a href="https://www.universityofgalway.ie/">University of Galway</a>. My work
            focused on using machine learning and deep learning to
            turn complex data into meaningful insights. I have a strong background in mathematics and
            programming, which helps me develop effective models for predicting trends and optimizing
            strategies. Currently, I am working on a Market Mix Modeling project at
            <a href="https://fractal.ai/">Fractal Analytics</a>
            , where
            I use data and statistical techniques to guide marketing investments.
