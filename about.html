            into
            actionable insights. My expertise lies in machine learning, deep learning, and advanced
            statistical techniques, all aimed at optimizing business decisions and driving profitability. I
            am currently pursuing a <b>master's in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial
                Intelligence</b> at the at <a href="https://www.universityofgalway.ie/"><b>University of
                    Galway</b></a>.</p>

        <p>Recently, I served as a <b>Subject Matter Expert</b> in Market Mix Modeling (MMM) for CPG/FMCG
            product
            categories at <a href="https://fractal.ai/"><b>Fractal Analytics</b></a>. My work in analyzing
            <b>marketing effectiveness</b> and optimizing advertisement investments led to a <b>projected
